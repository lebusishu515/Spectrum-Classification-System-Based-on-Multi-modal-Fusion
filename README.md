# Spectrum-Classification-System-Based-on-Multi-modal-Fusion
We independently collected and constructed a spectral database consisting of six types of signals, and used signal processing technology and digital twin technology to generate sample supplements for other modalities. Designed a multimodal fusion network and constructed a signal classification system based on multimodal fusion.
